# SDK Changes for Timestamp Value Fix

## Problem
The SDK was generating validation errors when unmarshalling API responses that contained timestamp values. The error was:

```
53 validation errors for Unmarshaller
body.values.created_at.0.PostV2ObjectsObjectRecordsValueTimestamp.value
  Datetimes provided to dates should have zero time - e.g. be exact dates [type=date_from_datetime_inexact]
```

This occurred because the Speakeasy code generator was incorrectly generating the `value` field of `PostV2ObjectsObjectRecordsValueTimestamp` as type `date` instead of `str`, even though the API returns full ISO 8601 timestamp strings like `"2025-10-01T07:10:52.888000000Z"`.

## Root Cause
The OpenAPI spec had the timestamp value field defined with:
- `type: string`
- `format: date-time`
- `x-speakeasy-type: date-time`

Speakeasy was interpreting the `format: date-time` and `x-speakeasy-type: date-time` fields to generate a Python `date` type, which cannot accept full datetime strings with time components.

## Solution
Changed the `value` field type from `date` to `str` in the following classes in `src/attio/models/post_v2_objects_object_recordsop.py`:

1. `PostV2ObjectsObjectRecordsValueTimestampTypedDict` (line 151)
2. `PostV2ObjectsObjectRecordsValueTimestamp` (line 168)

### Changes Made

#### File: `src/attio/models/post_v2_objects_object_recordsop.py`

**Line 151** - Changed from:
```python
value: date
```
To:
```python
value: str
```

**Line 168** - Changed from:
```python
value: date
```
To:
```python
value: str
```

## Testing
Verified the fix using the test script `test_unmarshal.py` which unmarshals the example.json response. The unmarshalling now succeeds:

```
âœ“ Unmarshalling successful!
Result type: <class 'attio.models.post_v2_objects_object_recordsop.PostV2ObjectsObjectRecordsDataResponse'>
```

## Note on Overlay
An attempt was made to fix this at the spec level using `overlay.yaml` to remove the `format` and `x-speakeasy-type` fields, but the overlay syntax did not work as expected. The fix was applied directly to the generated Python models.

## Impact
This change allows the SDK to correctly parse API responses containing timestamp values in record objects, enabling the `post_v2_objects_object_records()` method to work correctly with the returned data.
